    "## A tool to evaluate the topological preference of a TMH based on a population of TMHs with known topology\n",
    "\n",
    "This runs the TMH sequence through a positionally dependent matrix of residue scores and checks the total score between forwards/backwards runs of the TMH. A greater difference indicates a greater topological preference. The advantage of this method is that the individual contribution of each residue are calculated, and whilst the accuracy of the predictor may not always be the highest overall, it allows for sensitive evaluation of the topology of a TMP without the need for hidden layers in neural networks or HMMs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The input sequence should be a single TMH with 5 flanking residues either side. However, flanks are often fuzzy in biology, so determining the exact TMH boundary at a single residue position is difficult, if not, impossible. Users are encouraged to submit several versions of the TMH with different boundaries.\n",
